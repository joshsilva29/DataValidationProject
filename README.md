# DataValidationProject

This is a project for my CMSC335: Web Application Development with Javascript class that uses forms and PHP for practice with servers and GET/POST requests. 
To run this project, please download the source code and drag it to the "htdocs" folder of XAMPP or your respective Apache distribution.
To ensure the project runs successfully, I suggest downloading XAMPP here -> https://www.apachefriends.org/.
